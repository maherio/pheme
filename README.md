# Pheme
Pheme is a fantasy sports application which provides users with the latest news about their fantasy teams. Pheme won't discriminate between legitimate news sources and baseless rumors, so you'll hear every little rumbling about your players!

*Pheme was the Greek god most associated with rumors and gossip*

# Implementation details
